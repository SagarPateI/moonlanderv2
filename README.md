## 📄 Description

MoonLander v2 is a 3D simulation of a moon landing developed using React and three.js libraries. The project aims to provide an interactive and realistic experience of piloting a moon lander on the lunar surface. Users can control the moon lander's movement and perform a simulated landing on the moon.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React
- three.js
- @react-three/fiber
- @react-three/cannon
- CSS

## 🌟 Key Features

- Realistic 3D moon landing simulation.
- User-controllable moon lander movement.
- Responsive arrow key controls.
- Thruster activation using the space bar.
- Error handling with React ErrorBoundary.
- Dynamic camera following the moon lander.

## 🚧 Project Struggles & Challenges

Development presented several challenges, including control responsiveness, camera settings, third-party library integrations, positioning, and error handling. Each obstacle was overcome through iterative debugging and problem-solving.

During the development of this project, we faced several challenges, including:

- Unresponsive Controls: Correcting event listeners and state management issues to ensure smooth control functionality.

- FOV and Camera Problems: Adjusting the camera's field of view and positioning to capture the entire scene properly.

- Library Integration: Dealing with compatibility issues and frequent updates of third-party packages.

- Positioning and Layout: Ensuring proper alignment and resolving CSS conflicts for a visually pleasing experience.

- Error Handling: Spending time on error detection and employing various debugging techniques.
